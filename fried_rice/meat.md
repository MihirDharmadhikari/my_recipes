**Serves: 2**

## What you will need:

### Original ingredients
| No. | Ingredient | Quantity | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1  | Rice (uncooked) | 150 gm | Pre-cook the rice at least a few hours before, ideally a day before |
|2  | Vegetables | 100 gm | I prefer carrots, green peas, bell peppers |
|2  | Mushrooms | 30 gm | Mushrooms are a must, use Shitake mushrooms for the best flavour. See ['this'](#mushroom-cooking-tip) for special tip on cooking them |
|3  | Salami | 150 gm | [This one](https://meny.no/varer/palegg-frokost/spekemat/spekepolser/salami/slegge-salami-7090040910059) |
|4  | Shallots | 70 gm |  |
|5  | Ginger | 10-15 gm |  |
|6  | Garlic | 15-17 |  |
|7  | Chillies | 1 | Use the small spicy one. Skip this if you don't like the heat |
|8  | Eggs | 4 |  |
|9  | Spring onion | 1 | I don’t know what the correct unit of measuring spring onion is. One spring onion stick plus all the leaves it has is what you need |
|10  | Soy sauce | To taste |  |

### Substitutes:
| Substitute for | Substitute with | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Salami | Any spicy sausage | Any spicy sausage with high fat content will do |

| 1 | [King Oyster Mushrooms](https://meny.no/varer/frukt-gront/sopp/sopp/kongeosterssopp-7040517003319) | 1 big mushroom | If you like mushrooms, this adds a really nice flavour. They need to be cooked separately as described [here](#cooking-king-oyster-mushroom) |

## Recipie:

### Before you begin:
- Cook rice at least a few hours before (2-3), ideally the day before for best results. The rice must be cold and dry when you use it otherwise it will clump up.
- If you procrastinated and did not cook the rice in advance (shame on you) there is still hope. Cook the rice in an open pot. Once done, spread out the rice to let the steam release and let it dry while you do the rest of the preparations.

### Preparation:
- Chop all of the vegetables finely. The ideal rule is that the maximum dimension of everything has to be smaller than or equal to the maximum dimension of the grain of rice after cooking, but no need to be so strict.
- Separate the stem-like hard part and the leafy part of the spring onion.
- Chop the ginger, garlic, stem-like part of spring onion, and shallots (and chilies if you add them) finely. These are your aromatics.
- Chop the green part of the spring onions. Keep them separate from the rest. This will be primarily for the garnish so you can make it look pretty if you like.
- Finely chop the salami.
- Take two eggs and two egg yolks. Whisk them nicely and pass them through a sieve to make them smooth and uniform. Passing through sieve is optional.

### Cooking:
- Heat the wok on high heat.
- Cooking eggs:
  - Add some oil and let it get warm. If you see a little smoke it is ok just turn off the heat. Until you cook the eggs.
  - Pour the eggs slowly into the oil while stirring continuously.
  - The eggs will cook very fast. About 5-10 seconds after adding them they will be done. Strain them through a sieve to remove excess oil and water.
- Cooking the vegetables:
  - #### Mushroom cooking tip: 
    - If you really picky about your mushrooms (like me) you can cook the mushrooms separately. 
    - Chop them in quarters.
    - Add little bit of oil to the wok (not too much the mushrooms just absorb it)
    - Cook them in the wok until they get aromatic and a bit of a glaze. We need all the water inside them to evaporate. 
  - Bring the wok back to heat.
  - Add the vegetables and cook on high heat while stirring continuously. This retains the freshness and crunch while cooking them so you get roasted vegetables and not boiled vegetables. 
  - Once they release all the water and start to get a little char, remove them.
  - Since we chopped everything finely it won’t take long to cook it.
  
- Now we are ready to assemble everything. Things will now have to be done kind of fast, be prepared.
  - Bring the wok back to heat. I know I am writing this every time, but this is the only way you get nice dry fried rice and not boiled mushy fried rice.
  - Add oil to the wok.
  - Add the aromatics and cook for 20 seconds.
  - Add the chopped salami, eggs and rice. 
  - Mix everything until it is all combined. You will need to break the clumps of rice and eggs. Keep stir frying until the rice grains are separate. If things look very dry you can add oil.
  - Add the vegetables and mushrooms. Mix everything well.
  - Once things are mixed nicely, create a small well in between and add the soy sauce directly in the middle of the wok and around the rim (NOT ON THE RICE). Mix well until everything is uniformly coated. You should get a light brown color on the rice.
  - Now stir and let it cook for about 30-45 seconds more. Turn off the heat.
  - Taste and add some salt if the soy sauce is not enough. You can add more soy sauce also if you like but then you need to turn on the heat and add it like it is described above.
- Add half the green part of the spring onions and mix.
- Remove the fried rice onto a plate and garnish with the remaining spring onion greens.


### Cooking King Oyster Mushroom
You can prepare this the same way as the rest of the vegetables, but the method I am about to describe gives it a nicer texture.
**You will need a pan for this**
- Chop the mushrooms to make these long strips (~5mm thick, 3-4 slices per mushroom) like [this](https://thenewgrocer.com/cdn/shop/products/A06D680C-80FE-4650-8A3F-82A898D865EC_1_201_a.jpg?v=1672445035).
- Heat a pan on high heat, add some oil.
- Place the mushroom strips in the pan and press them to get a nice sear.
- Lower the heat to medium-high.
- Flip when the develop a golden brown color.
- Cook on the other side until golden brown.
- Remove from the pan finely chop them and mix with the rest of the vegetables.
